API request/response schemas (Pydantic).

WHY THESE ARE SEPARATE FROM domain/models.py
It is tempting to return domain objects directly. Don't — they are different
things with different reasons to change:

  - Domain models change when the PIPELINE's rules change.
  - API schemas change when a CLIENT's needs change.

Coupling them means a harmless internal rename becomes a breaking API change,
and an internal field you never meant to expose (last_error with a stack trace,
an object storage key, a reviewer's id) gets serialized to whoever is calling.
The mapping is a few lines of boilerplate and it is worth it.

TODO (junior dev): implement these as pydantic BaseModel classes with real
validation. Validate at the EDGE so nothing invalid reaches a service.
