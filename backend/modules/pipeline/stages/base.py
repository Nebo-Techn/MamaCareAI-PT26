"""
Stage base class — retries, idempotency, transitions, and metrics in ONE place.

WHY A BASE CLASS HERE (and not copy-paste in seven files)
Every stage needs identical plumbing: load the resource, check it is in a state
this stage handles, do the work, transition it, publish the next job, record
the audit event, emit metrics, and decide retry-vs-dead-letter on failure.
Written seven times, that plumbing is wrong in at least three of them within a
month — and the wrong ones will be the stages nobody looks at.

So `run()` is a TEMPLATE METHOD: it owns the plumbing and calls the one
abstract hook each stage actually implements. Subclasses write business logic
only. When you need to change retry policy, you change it here, once.

This is also Open/Closed at the stage level: new stage = new subclass, no edits
to the runner or the worker.

TODO (junior dev): implement `run()` carefully — every other stage inherits its
correctness from this method. Get it reviewed before building on it.
