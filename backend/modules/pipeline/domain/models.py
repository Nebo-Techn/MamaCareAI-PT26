"""
Domain models — the common schema every stage speaks.

THE KEY IDEA (PDF 3.2)
A web page, a PDF, and a video transcript all converge into ONE shape:
`NormalizedDocument`. After extraction, nothing downstream is allowed to care
where the content came from. Translation does not branch on "if this was a
PDF". Review does not branch on "if this was a video".

If you ever need `if resource.source_type == ...` inside stages/ after the
extraction stage, that is a design smell — the difference belongs in an
adapter, not in a use case.

These are frozen dataclasses on purpose: a stage produces a NEW object rather
than mutating a shared one, so a half-finished mutation can never be written
to the database when a later step throws.

TODO (junior dev):
  [ ] Keep these free of persistence concerns. No `to_sql()`, no `__tablename__`.
      Mapping to database rows is the repository adapter's job, not the model's.
  [ ] Add fields when a real feature needs them. An unused field is a lie about
      what the pipeline guarantees.
