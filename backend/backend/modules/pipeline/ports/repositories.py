"""
Ports: repositories — structured pipeline state (PDF 3.5, relational database).

Four small interfaces instead of one big `Database` class. That is Interface
Segregation: the translate stage needs resources and versions, not review
assignments, so it depends only on what it uses — and a test fake for it only
has to implement what it uses.

Ports return DOMAIN OBJECTS, never ORM rows, dicts, or database cursors. If
`Resource` leaks a SQLAlchemy model into a stage, the stage is now coupled to
the database and the layering is broken.
