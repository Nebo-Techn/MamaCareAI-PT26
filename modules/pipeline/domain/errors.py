Pipeline exception hierarchy.

WHY THIS MATTERS FOR ROBUSTNESS
The orchestrator has to answer one question every time a stage throws:
"should I retry this, or is retrying pointless?" Retrying a 503 from a
translation API is correct. Retrying a password-protected PDF forever burns
money and hides the real problem in a retry loop.

So every exception here declares `retryable`. `stages/base.py` reads that flag
and either re-queues with backoff or sends the job straight to the
dead-letter queue.

TODO (junior dev):
  [ ] Never raise a bare `Exception` inside a stage. Wrap it in the right
      subclass here so the retry decision is explicit and reviewable.
  [ ] When you add an adapter, map its library-specific errors onto these
      types at the adapter boundary — stages must never catch `botocore` or
      `httpx` exceptions directly.
